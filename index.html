  <h1>Why Sourdough Doesn’t Have to Be Scary</h1>
   <div class="section">
  
    <p>Most people will tell you that making sourdough is hard — complicated, intimidating, and reserved only for seasoned bakers with years of experience. But here’s the truth: it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
  
    <p>Sure, sourdough has its quirks — you’re working with a living culture, after all — but once you understand the basic rhythm, it becomes a calming, even therapeutic process. In fact, it’s one of the most rewarding types of bread you can make right from your own kitchen.</p>
  
    <p>That’s why I’ve put together this simple, follow-along recipe and blog — to show you that sourdough is totally doable, even for beginners. Whether you’re just getting started or you've tried and given up before, this guide will walk you through each step with clarity and confidence. Let’s demystify sourdough together — one bubbly starter and crusty loaf at a time!</p>

    <h2> What Tools You Will Need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Jar or container for starter</li>
      <li>Mixing bowls</li>
      <li>Dough scraper</li>
      <li>Bench scraper</li>
      <li>Dutch oven</li>
      <li>Proofing basket or towel-lined bowl</li>
      <li>A kitchen scale(optional)</li>
      <li>Thermometer (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="highlight">Tip: Don’t let tools hold you back — start with the basics and upgrade later!</p>

    <h2>How to Make the Starter</h2>
    <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Mix ½ cup of flour with ¼ cup of water in a jar. Stir, cover loosely, and let sit at room temp.</p>
    <p><strong>Days 2–6:</strong> Discard half, then feed daily with ½ cup flour + ¼ cup water. Bubbles and rise will increase.</p>
    <p><strong>By Day 7:</strong> Starter should double in size within 4–6 hours of feeding — then it’s ready to use!</p>

    <h2>Your Daily Sourdough Schedule</h2>
    <p>This schedule is flexible, but here’s a simple outline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Night before:</strong> Feed your starter.</li>
      <li><strong>8 AM:</strong> Mix dough.</li>
      <li><strong>9 AM–12 PM:</strong> Stretch & fold every 30 min.</li>
      <li><strong>1–2 PM:</strong> Let dough rise (bulk fermentation).</li>
      <li><strong>3 PM:</strong> Shape the dough.</li>
      <li><strong>4 PM:</strong> Cold proof in fridge overnight.</li>
      <li><strong>Next morning:</strong> Bake from the fridge.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a weak or inactive starter</li>
      <li>Rushing fermentation</li>
      <li>Using too much flour while shaping</li>
      <li>Cutting into warm bread — let it cool!(This one is optional I am inpatient too!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="highlight">Reminder: Even failed loaves teach you something. Embrace the process!</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Baking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix your sourdough starter and warm water together in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Add flour, salt, and honey (if using). Mix until you have a shaggy dough.</li>
      <li>Let the dough rest (autolyse) for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
      <li>Perform four sets of stretch and folds, spaced about 30 minutes apart (don’t stress if the timing isn’t exact).</li>
      <li>Let the dough bulk ferment for about 4 hours at room temp.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into two loaves and shape into tight rounds.</li>
      <li>Add your inclusions (like cheese, nuts, herbs, or fruit) during shaping or folding, if using.</li>
      <li>Place dough in a floured linen-lined proofing basket or banneton.</li>
      <li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours — or up to 4 days for more flavor development.</li>
      <li>When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C) with your Dutch oven inside.</li>
      <li>Bake covered for 25–30 minutes, then uncover and bake another 20–25 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li>Optional: Add ice cubes to your Dutch oven for extra steam, or rice to prevent a burnt bottom.</li>
      <li>Bread is fully baked when the internal temp reaches about 205°F (96°C).</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="highlight">Let it cool before slicing — even if you're impatient!</p>
